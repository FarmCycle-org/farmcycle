# üå± FarmCycle

**FarmCycle** is a hyperlocal web platform that connects **food waste providers** (like households, cafes, and hostels) with **waste collectors** (like farmers, gardeners, NGOs). Our goal is to build a **zero-waste, sustainable ecosystem** that promotes composting and responsible waste management ‚Äî one neighborhood at a time.


## üöÄ Why FarmCycle?

Every day, tons of organic waste are discarded, while compost users spend resources acquiring compost. **FarmCycle** bridges this gap through:

‚úÖ Real-time listing of available food waste  
‚úÖ Hyperlocal matches between providers and collectors  
‚úÖ Role-based access and features  
‚úÖ Organized request tracking, notifications, and history  
‚úÖ Encouraging communities to go zero-waste üåç
