FarmCycle: Transform Waste into a Resource
FarmCycle is a full-stack web application designed to connect businesses and individuals with organic waste to local farms and compost facilities. Our platform streamlines the process of waste collection, turning an environmental challenge into an opportunity for sustainability and efficiency.

Key Features
Role-Based Dashboards: The platform features distinct user roles for Providers and Collectors, each with a dedicated dashboard that tracks key metrics like total waste collected, requests, and environmental impact.

Dynamic Waste Listings: Providers can easily create, edit, and manage detailed listings for their available organic waste. Each listing includes an image, waste type, quantity, and a precise location.

Streamlined Request Management: The system allows Collectors to browse available waste listings and submit claims for pickup. Providers can then manage and accept these requests through a simple interface.

Secure & Robust: Built with secure JWT authentication, the application ensures protected, role-based access for every user.
